Calling compound heterozygous mutations
=======================================

This step uses ``granite comHet`` to call compound heterozygous mutations by genes and transcripts, assigning the associate risk based on available annotations. The output vcf file is checked for integrity to ensure the format is correct and the file is not truncated.
